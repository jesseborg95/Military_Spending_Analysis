# Military Spending Analysis
Project using Python to analyze the military spending of 10 different countries between 2013 and 2018 inclusive. Exploratory data analysis, data mining, data cleaning, matplotlib.

## Motivation
I performed this project for my Intro to Data Mining class at The George Washington University. The requirements for the project were to perform exploratory data analysis and gain important information and insights, using a sizable dataset of your choice using Python.

## Data Source
I chose to analyze the military spending of 10 countries which were assigned to me, using data sets I obtained from The World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/).

## Using the Files
* The .csv files show the raw data used for the project.
* The .ipynb file shows all of my code. This file can be downloaded and ran to get the final output.
* The .html file is the html version of my final report. Look at this if you are only interested in the output of the analysis. To view the html file, go to http://htmlpreview.github.io/?file:///C:/Users/12023/Desktop/First_Year_Material/Data_Mining/Project%201/Military%20Spending%20Analysis.html
